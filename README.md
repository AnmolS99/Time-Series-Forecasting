# Time Series Forecasting 📈

This project was part of the Deep Learning (IT3030) course at NTNU spring 2022. The goal of this project was to use time series forecasting to predict transmission system imbalance.

## Installation

To install required packages, use the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Datasets

The datasets includes production plans and historical imbalance data for east Norway (NO1 area in the figure below).

The datasets contain the following features:
• start time: The timestamp of each datum.
• hydro: The planned reservoir hydropower production at the time step.
• micro: The planned small-scale hydropower production at the time step.
• river: The planned run-of-river hydropower production at the time step.
• thermal: The planned thermal power plant production at the time step.
• wind: The planned wind power plant production at the time step.

• total: The total planned production at the time step. Equal to the sum of the listed ”planned production”
features.
• sys reg: The planned ”system regulation” at the time step: activation of balancing services to accommodate
specific needs (e.g. bottlenecks) in the power system.
• flow: The planned total power flow in or out of the current area of the grid at the time step. At any moment,
power flows between connected bidding areas. This value is the net power flow from the current area, i.e.
positive numbers indicate export and negative numbers indicate import.
• y: The target variable that you train your network to predict. The estimated ”open loop” power
grid imbalance at the time step. Think of this as the imbalance, per area, that would have occurred if balancing
services were not activated. It is not possible to observe this value directly, thus it has to be estimated using
other measurements of the power grid.
